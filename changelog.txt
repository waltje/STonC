  implementation is accurate except for the N bit

Earlier changes
---------------

The date of earlier changes was not recorded; here is a selection from
the old todo.txt (recorded on 2002-12-16):
- added, tested binary hash
- emulated the video screen by poor man's OCR techniques
- fixed: dir c: crashes but not dir c:\ in gemdos.c
- fixed: several Fwrite() crash, using gemdos.c or not. (was due to short
  stack)
- ocr: added a better font bitmap format
- ocr: the font file is now a parameter
- backspace did not work correctly in editline
- the ui prompt did not appear after commands
- understood why the keyboard is dead after reset
  - checked that the ikbd.c and stkbd.c work after reset
  - changed a bug in mfp.c set_ddr(), which solves the problem for 
    nulltos but now the TOS does not boot. (screen rez problem !)
  - changed STORE_B_ff8260 effect on bit 7 of gpip in io.c, now it works
- added a command to change the monitor type (mono/color) in ui
- initial copyright message appears on the ui
- the screen is not scanned unless the screen terminal is selected
- acia.c; ikbd.c is connected to an actual ACIA allowing future midi 
  emulation
- ikdb emulated from curses (need to know the actual keyboard layout to 
  convert between ascii characters and scancodes, including modifiers)
- help in ui
- usart and timer D: alarm set every byte, not every bit
- error messages displayed in the ui terminal always
- simple configuration variables in the embedded shell
- multiple DMA controllers, multiple hard disks
- converted fdc and hdc emulation to stdio streams. Done, keeping
  the unistd alternative for fdc
- replaced gettimeofday() by time()
- reset did not work 
- longjmp/setjmp are used to return from bus and address errors; previously 
  execute() nested, which caused trouble when going back to ui
- removed MFP debug messages about timers
- moved all old autoconf stuff in Oldconf/, and cleaned the Makefile for 
  two configs (namely linux x86 and cygwin)
- merged EmulC in the directory structure
