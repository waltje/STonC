Version 0.8.1 is an interim release correcting some bugs. 

STonC now comes with a custom build of EmuTOS directly.
You can run it directly by doing:
  (cd Samples; ./go_emutos)

The following was tested OK on this version of STonC:

- Nulltos + Minix (floppy boot, hard disk installation)
- TOS 1.02 US,  TOS 2.06 US, EmuTOS CVS 2004-01-07 
  (executing COMMAND.PRG located in AUTO directory on floppy)
  
Enjoy,

Laurent Vogel
