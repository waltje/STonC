debug switches are currently scattered in various files.
Here is a quick list of some of them.

stonxcpu/cpu.c:
PCLOG - dump all PC locations in a big file
JMPLOG - display pc location when the pc jumps more than 10 bytes at a time

stonxcpu/cpubis.c:
uncomment debug code to display more info when exceptions are triggered

machine/syscalls.h:
TRACE_SYSCALLS - display calls to BIOS and GEMDOS functions with arguments

That's it for now. Eventually it should be possible to control more of these
options at runtime... but that will have to wait.
