INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=========================

QUICK INSTALL
=============

To install stonc on any decent Linux or Cygwin, this paragraph should 
be sufficient. In case of trouble, or if you have a different configuration, 
I'm afraid you'll also have to read the rest of this document and be lucky.

Installing is a smple matter of typing:

  make

and then with write priviledge in /usr/local (e.g. as root) typing:

  make install

This will create a stonc executable in /usr/local/bin, and a directory
/usr/local/share/stonc.  To run stonc either type directly

  stonc

or you can adapt scripts found in Samples to your needs. 
Remember to make sure your terminal is at least 80x25 characters in size.


REQUIREMENTS
============

In order to compile STonC, you will need the following:

 * A C compiler, preferably GNU C (but some ANSI C compilers, like DEC's
  will do)

 * The M4 macro processor

 * some kind of curses library (ncurses of pdcurses2.4 work)

 * GNU make
 
These will suffice to get you started (unless I've forgotten something). 


CONFIGURATION
=============

STonC does not use a "configure" script right now. You will have to
adapt the Makefile to change
- your particular compiler options
- the location of the curses library

You may also need to have a look at include/options.h and include/config.h.
Unfortunately changing these will result in an untested configuration.

The only options that you might need to change are IS_BIG_ENDIAN and
SMALL (check if this is defined in the `config.h' as well), which should 
be set to 1 if your system has less than 16MB physical memory or if 
linking fails otherwise (it will result in an emulator which emulates 
4MB RAM instead of 14MB, and takes up approximately 9MB swap space 
instead of 17MB).
