Release notes for STonC version 0.7.0
=====================================

This version of STonC originated as a port of the latest version
of STonX (version 0.6.7 epsilon) with enhancements (more hardware 
emulated), to curses, dropping audio and X support in the process.

plans are 
- to integrate some of the relevant additions to STonX (typically 
  not the xlib or joystick stuff)
- to add support for faster CPU engines
- to experiment other toolkits (allegro, gtk ?)
- ultimately to merge with STonX.
