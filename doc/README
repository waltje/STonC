This is STonC, a port of STonX to curses.

What is it?
===========

a port of STonX to curses, with enhancements.

STonC or STonX?
===============

In the future it may well be that STonC and STonX merge together. 
Until this happens, if you don't know whether to use on or the other, 
consider this:

STonX features not present in STonC are (at the time of writing)
- Xlib graphical display, with a speedy native xlib-vdi
- sound support
- experimental joystick support

STonC features not present in STonX are
- terminal text-only screen rendering allowing copy and paste
- more accurate hardware emulation (mfp)
- serial vt100-like terminal
- dma hard disk emulation
- some run-time configurability (eject floppies, ...) 

In short, STonC was targetted at running Minix (requiring more
hardware than supplied by STonX) with some windows portability
(hence the curses port that was more simple to handle for me than
a full-fledge graphical environment)

Documentation
=============

read the INSTALL file for installation instructions
read the MANUAL for (some) documentation
There is also additional info on how to install Minix or
MiNT in STonC.

Future work
===========

Potential future directions could be:
- support for faster CPU emulation.
- experiment with other toolkits like the allegro library, or GTK+.
- merge back into STonX.
